Demo\nThis project was a small implemantation of a ecomerce platform that inlcudes a product the user can make a payment using his card details. \n#Things I did for this Demo\n\nI used the latest Angular 7 and the latest Angular Material components https://material.angular.io/\nFor the single store managment I used https://ngrx.io/ to implement the REDUX pattern\nTDD using karma and jasmine so run npm run test\nStub the responses using a nodejs server under the fe-mock-server folder npm run fe-mocks\nUse Docker to run to build and run the application within a docker nginx server so this code can be deployed to any server and you can try it by running npm run docker and visit http://localhost with the enviroment variables ready to be changed for production under this file src/environments/environment.prod.ts\nUsed a simple media query and flexbox for responsive design \nI added delay in the mock responses to show the spinner when the request is loading (for DEMO porpuses)\nCreated seperate small shared components for Product and for Payment Form and then I included those to the redux container components\nI did BDD acceptance end-to-end tests using cucamber and protractor under the /e2e folder run npm run e2e\nRun an online documentation of the project and it's components by running npm run compodoc and serving it at http://127.0.0.1:8080/\nConstantly checking for linting errors using codelyzer check them by running npm run lint\n\n#Things I could improve if I was spending more time \n\nThere was no negative scenarios managed in this simple example I did only the happy path as there was not required and there was not link in the secription to show error sample responses\nI could have spend more time on it to make it better and I could use material grid list or boostrap grid or any other framework but this is out of the scope of the this test\nI diden't use validation to the fields as I diden't have any specific requirments but If I had I would do this using reactiveForms. Only thing I did I add  HTML5 basic max-length rules.\n\nInstall Dependancies\nRun npm\nCheck for linting errors\nRun npm run lint\nRun Frontend Mock Server\nRun npm run fe-mocks to run the Frontend mock server (this stubs the world pay responses as requested)\nDevelopment server\nRun npm run fe-mocks to run the mock server first and then\nRun npm start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun npm run build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng run test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun npm run fe-mocks to start the mock server\nRun npm start to start the application\nAnd finally \nRun npm run e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor and cucamber\nDocker\nRun npm run docker to build and run the application within a docker nginx server ready to be deployed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
